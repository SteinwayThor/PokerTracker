Welcome to my poker tracker (and, ultimately, Heads Up Display) for America's Cardroom.

This program parses the local stored text files that America's Cardroom creates of hand histories. It seeks to collect all relevant statistics on opponents for exploitative play, including VPIP, CBet%, and ranges.

Next Steps:
1) Heavy reliance on text patterns. Unusual player usernames could interfere with my algorithm.
  => Cannot be easily resolved on my end. Access to an API would obviously make data collection more consistent.
2) Work with the data collected from the parser (also decide which data to discard since there are technically unlimited game trees in each hand).
